# Ridge, Lasso, and Principal Components Regression (Water Data)

We created two models using a dataset collection of 300 sampled water districts in the Philippines. 

The first model is a regression model with water prices as the output variable while 
the second one is a categorical model where we created an output variable called wastage rating. 

The Ridge, Lasso, and Principal Components Regression were employed in creating the models. It has been found that the best
model for the regression model is the Lasso Regression Model, with an RMSE of 0.253. 

On the other hand, the Principal Components Regression Model has been found to be the best model for classification
with an AUC of 0.509 and 54% Accuracy.
